/*In this course, I learn   arithmetic operators,

/*After addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, we see 
  parentheses, eponentiation.
*/
echo 5 * 6 +3- 1;
//results:32
echo 5 * (6 +3)- 1;
/*results: 44 because here,
  we calcul the addition in parentheses first,
    then we calculate the multiplication.
Modulus operators:
$a=2;
$b=3;
$b % $a //output 1
$c= 15;
$d = 5;
$c % $d //output 3
Shortland increment, decrement 
$a = $a +1
$a++
$b = $b- 1
$b--

The functions: reusable snippets of code that can be called 
multiples times
The built-in-functions = functions natives 
view in php manual

optionnal or named arguments
function multiplier ($z, $b)
{
  return $a * $multipliee
}
echo multiplier (4,4);

Anonymous functions or callbacks functions
$names = array
(
  "Joe",
  "Louis,
  "Brenda
);
usort allow to comapre greater than, less than, equal.

Class is a way of grouping variables and functions as a single unit
The classes have objects: instances of a class
Variables in classes called "properties"
Function in classes called "methods"

Example:
//create 1st object
$louis = new Person ("Louis");

//create 2nd object
$brenda = new Person ("Brenda");

//Get name
echo $louis->get_name; / echo $brenda->get_name;

//Set name
echo $louis->set_name(32); / echo $brenda->set_name(46);
